                <p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project
                    similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers
                    and colleagues. R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly
                    extensible. One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can
                    be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken
                    over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.</p>
                <p>R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public
                    License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar
                    systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.</p>
                <p>R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical
                    display. It includes
                <ul>
                    <li>an effective data handling and storage facility,</li>
                    <li>a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,</li>
                    <li>a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,</li>
                    <li>graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and</li>
                    <li>a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops,
                        user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <header>Data types and structures</header>
                <p>R has 6 basic data types out of which the five most important are listed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>character ("abc", "John", "This is a sentence.")</li>
                    <li>numeric (real: 2, 5, 100, float: 2.5, 3.14)</li>
                    <li>integer (2L)</li>
                    <li>logical (TRUE and FALSE)</li>
                    <li>complex (2+5i)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>R has many data structures as well that can contain the above mentioned data types. The most
                    important are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>atomic vectors: a homogeneous 1d data type</li>
                    <li>lists: a (potentially) heterogeneous 2d data type</li>
                    <li>matrix: 2d data structure consisting of homogeneous data</li>
                    <li>factors: for cathegorical data</li>
                    <li>data frames: consisting of vectors of equal length</li>
                </ul>
                <p>R has functions to get information about the data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>class()</code> - the type of object (data structure e.g. matrix, df, list) </li>
                    <li><code>typeof()</code> - the type of data within object (numeric, integer, logical, etc.)</li>
                    <li><code>length()</code> - to get the number of items within data structure</li>
                    <li><code>dim()</code> - to get the dimensions (length or number of rows and columns)</li>
                    <li><code>str()</code> - the basic structure of the object (e.g. type of columns of data frame)</li>
                </ul>

                <header>Printing with R</header>
                <p>R has autoprint. So calling an object by name automatically prints its contents.</p>
                <p>In addition R has several functions with various parameters for more complex printing.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>print()</code> - this is the generic print function with several useful parameters, such
                        as 'quote' to remove quotation marks (default is TRUE)</li>
                    <li><code>paste()</code> - this makes it possible to pass more than one argument, and paste them
                        together using separator 'sep'. The result can also be stored in a variable</li>
                    <li><code>cat()</code> - is only for printing, and it accepts several arguments, and prints strings
                        without quotation marks.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <header>Packages</header>
                <p>In addition to the basic functions included in the <code>base</code> package, the functionality of R
                    can be enhanced by several powerful packages. There is a package for almost any problem that someone
                    dealing with statistics might encounter. Some of the most popular packages are dplyr, ggplot2,
                    xlsx2, and R has its own package rmarkdown to produce markdown reports with actual code running in
                    the background and supplying the results that one wants to present.</p>
                <p>These resources combined provide all the necessary tools to read, tidy, manipulate, analyze data, and
                    to present the results in a compelling form.</p>
